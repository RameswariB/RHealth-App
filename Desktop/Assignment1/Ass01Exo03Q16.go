16 â€“	An electricity bill is calculated by obtaining the number of days for which electricity is supplied and the number
of kilowatt hours (kWh) consumed. The client is billed at a rate of $0.50 per day and $0.30 per kWh. For a client that has
 consumed more than 200 kWh, their rate is reduced from $0.30 to $0.20 for additional kWh. We want to obtain the total amount for the bill.
