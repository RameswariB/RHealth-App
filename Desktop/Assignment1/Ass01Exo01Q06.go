6 â€“	A dealership selling new vehicles asks you to construct a program that calculates the compensation paid to their salespeople.
 The base salary for all the salespeople is $400. For each vehicle sold, the salesperson receives a commission of $200. Also,
  the salesperson receives a bonus of 5% of the total amount of all their sales.
Make the program for a salesperson.
